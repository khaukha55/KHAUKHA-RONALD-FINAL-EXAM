# Toy Store

This is a toy store site using React and create-react-app, with a little Bootstrap. NOTE: this is NOT a real store site. You are NOT able to actually buy products on this site. This is just a pretend site to practice my React skills.

The toys come from a list I created in a javascript file as an object. There is no backend or API I get the toys from.
